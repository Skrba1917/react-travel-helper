React application that helps you find out fancy places around the world.

I've worked with Travel Advisor (RapidAPI), used hooks, functional based components, axios, materialUI...

Some of the options are: checking out restaurants, hotels, attractions around you, visiting website of selected place, visiting Trip Advisor of selected place, navigating through world map to see other places, detailed info (rating, location, phone, reviews) of all types of places and more.

Website is deployed on Netlify.

***No billing account on google cloud is enabled so map is showing in deployment-mode only***
