React application that helps you find out fancy places around the world.

I've worked with Travel Advisor (RapidAPI), used hooks, functional based components, axios, materialUI...

Some of the options are: checking out restaurants, hotels, attractions around you, visiting site of selected place, navigating through world map to see other places, detailed info about all types of places and more.
